# Glossary

We know the discourse of ecommerce changes over time. If we find a word choice in our vocabulary doesn’t make sense anymore, we'll change it.

### 1, 2, 3

<dl class="ml-4">
<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
2-step verification
</dt>

### A

able to
</dt>
<dd>
Avoid using sentences using “You will be able to….” Instead, just say “You can….” It’s shorter and easier to scan.
</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
add
</dt>
<dd>
Use “add” when referring to the act of putting a thing with another group of things. Compare this with “connect,” which refers to the act of joining two things together.

For example, users can add products to their catalog. They can also connect their BigCommerce site with a marketplace, like Amazon or Facebook.
</dd>
<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
App Marketplace

### B

<dl class="ml-4">

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">

</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">

</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)

Treat “Buy Now, Pay Later” as a branded, proper noun and use title case.
</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
buy online, pick up in-store (BOPIS)
</dt>
<dd>
“Pick up” is a verb and should be two words, no hyphen. “In-store” is an adjective describing the type of pick up. In the UK, “buy online, pick up in-store” is called “click and collect.”

At BigCommerce, the default language for UX writing is American English. Accordingly, always use “buy online, pick up in-store.”

Don’t abbreviate as BOPIS.
</dd>

</dl>

### C

<dl class="ml-4">

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
cancel
</dt>
<dd>
“Cancel” means, “I don’t want to do this anymore.” Any in-progress changes should be discarded as a result of clicking the button.

Don’t use “stop,” “pause,” “terminate” or “nevermind” and don’t use “cancel” in place of “back.”
</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
catalog
</dt>
<dd>
A catalog is a collection of virtual representations of a merchant’s saleable products for a channel, stored within the BigCommerce platform. A catalog contains products. Products can be both physical and digital. For the latter, think music downloads, digital images, treatments, services, etc. A collection of products, sorted by the user for merchandising purposes, is called a category.
</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">

<dd>
A collection of products, sorted by the user for merchandising purposes.

</dt>
<dd>
Use check out (verb) when referring to the act of paying for items and creating an order.

Use checkout (noun) when talking about the place shoppers go to pay for items and create an order.

Use checkout (adjective) when describing the type of page or process.

Never use check-out.
</dd>

<Dos>
<div class="hidden">
Do
</div>
 - Ready to check out?
 - When you’re done shopping, proceed to the checkout.
 - Navigate to the checkout page.
</Dos>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
click
</dt>
<dd>
Since we don’t know if a user is on a desktop or mobile device, avoid using “click” when instructing the user on how to complete an action within the UI. Whenever possible, write around the issue with generic verbs like “choose,” “select” or “pick.”

Avoid using “hit."
</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
clickthrough, click-through
</dt>
<dd>
Use “clickthrough” (noun) when referring to an instance or multiple instances of clickthrough. Use “click through” (verb) when referring to the act of following a link or button to another site or location.

</dt>
<dd>

</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">

For example, users can add products to their catalog. They can also connect their BigCommerce site with a marketplace, like Amazon or Facebook.

When writing about an integration between BigCommerce and another third party technology, you’ll probably be using “connect.”
</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">

Do not use “next.”
</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
control panel
</dt>
<dd>
Control panel is not a proper noun. No need to capitalize. Of course, always capitalize the first letter of the first word if it appears at the start of a sentence. Keep in mind, there are very few instances when you’ll need to refer to the control panel by name. Most of the time you’ll just say “store.”
</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
create
</dt>
<dd>
Use “create,” as opposed to “save,” as the CTA when creating a product, customer, setting, object, item etc. for the first time. When making changes to something that already exists, use “save” as the CTA.
</dd>

<dt class="font-bold mt-4">
customer
</dt>
<dd>
Use “customer” when referring to our users’ end-user: the customer. You can use “customer” and “shopper” interchangeably. Just keep in mind, depending on the context, there can be a subtle difference between a shopper and a customer. A shopper is a visitor to a merchant’s storefront who hasn’t necessarily purchased anything.

To avoid confusion, try not to use “customer” to refer to BigCommerce clients. Use “merchant,” “retailer” or “brand” instead.

optional vs. required
</dt>
<dd>
Label optional fields. Don’t label required fields. More often than not, a given settings page will have more required fields than optional fields. As such, it makes more sense to denote any optional fields as those are the ones deviating from the merchant’s expectations.

Also keep in mind, if a given setting has a default option, it’s not an optional setting and shouldn’t be labeled as such.
